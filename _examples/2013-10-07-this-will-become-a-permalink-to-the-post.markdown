First paragraph.

Second paragraph. Paragraphs must be divided with at least two new lines. One new line gives nothing.

Some basic formatting applies: **bold**, *italic*.

The "author_login" denotes your photograph's filename from [the image database](https://github.com/softwaremill/jekyll-softwaremill/tree/master/img/members). If you haven't got a photo yet, use "no-image".

Remember to wrap the blog post on circular in {nofo: (no format). 

Use h4 (####) for main headers and h3 (###) for subheaders. 

In order to get a single line, do a double space (hit enter twice).
