SQS, [Simple Message Queue](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs), is a message-queue-as-a-service offering from Amazon Web Services. It supports only a handful of messaging operations, far from the complexity of e.g. [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/), but thanks to the easy to understand interfaces, and the as-a-service nature, it is very useful in a number of situations.

SQS provides at-least-once delivery. It also guarantees that if a send completes, the message is replicated to multiple nodes; quoting from the website:

> "Amazon SQS runs within Amazon’s high-availability data centers, so queues will be available whenever applications need them. To prevent messages from being lost or becoming unavailable, all messages are stored redundantly across multiple servers and data centers."

We don’t really know how SQS is implemented, but it most probably spreads the load across many servers, so including it here is a bit of an unfair competition: the other systems use a single replicated cluster, while SQS can employ multiple replicated clusters and route/balance the messages between them. But since we have the results, let’s see how it compares.

A single thread on single node achieves **405 msgs/s** sent and the same number of msgs received.

These results are not impressive, but SQS scales nicely both when increasing the number of threads, and the number of nodes. On a single node, with 50 threads, we can send up to **14 930 msgs/s**, and receive up to **4 800 msgs/s**.

On an 8-node cluster, these numbers go up to **109 460 msgs/s** sent, and **41 000 msgs/s** received!
