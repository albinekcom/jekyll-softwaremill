<p id="Postyarchiwalne-CertifiedJBosstrainings">We had a busy Summer here at SoftwareMill, so now in Autumn we would like to update our blog with information about the most recent events.</p>
<p>In July we signed a partnership agreement with <a href="http://bel.pl/" rel="nofollow">B2B sp. z o.o.</a> (Red Hat partner in Poland).</p>
<p>Within the cooperation SoftwareMill will lead certified RedHat trainings on JBoss technologies. We also provide technical support for projects carried out by B2B using JBoss Application Server and other JBoss products.</p>
<p>We have thus joined the small group of companies offering world-renowned training services – completing such a training allows developers to fully use their programming tools.</p>
