<p> </p>
<p>We are very happy to announce that we have launched the public beta version of our new product – <a href="https://www.jbison.com/" rel="nofollow">JBison.com</a>. After many weeks of the closed beta version we decided that the system is ready to be shown to the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jbison.com/" rel="nofollow">JBison</a> lets you run monitors that will check whether WWW and JBoss servers are working without obstacle. Checks are run every 5 minutes, so if anything goes wrong, you will be quickly informed about it by email.</p>
<p><a href="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dashboard.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1012" alt="JBison" src="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dashboard.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a></p>
<p>At the moment, two types of monitors are available:</p>
<h3 id="Postyarchiwalne-JBossMonitor">JBoss Monitor</h3>
<p>Using the JBoss Monitor, you can check how much memory (heap and PermGen) your servers are currently using, and also check the list of deployed applications. To start this monitor running, you have to provide the jmx-console address and your login and password.</p>
<p><a href="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/add_monitor.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1013" alt="JBison" src="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/add_monitor.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Your data are stored securely, using a 256-bit encryption key.</p>
<p>You can also view the history of memory usage as a graph, which allows you to find leaks easily (in the case of growing usage). Additionally, you can export the check results in CSV format and use your favourite tools to analyse the data.</p>
<h3 id="Postyarchiwalne-PingMonitor">Ping Monitor</h3>
<p>To add a Ping Monitor, you simply provide the URL you want to check. Additionally, you can provide a string that should be available on the target page.<br>Furthermore, you can also view a graph showing how long accessing the server and getting the result took.</p>
<p><a href="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/graphs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" alt="graphs" src="https://softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/graphs.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h4 id="Postyarchiwalne-Tocome">To come</h4>
<p id="Postyarchiwalne-Variousnotificationmethods">Various notification methods</p>
<p>We plan to add text message and telephone notification about events.</p>
<h4 id="Postyarchiwalne-Newmonitors">New monitors</h4>
<p>We plan to introduce new types of monitors. Our long list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database monitor</li>
<li>VoIP monitor</li>
<li>SSH monitor</li>
<li>… tell us what you really need!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Postyarchiwalne-API">API</h4>
<p>We would love others to integrate with our system. We are working on a public API through which <a href="https://www.jbison.com/" rel="nofollow">JBison</a> would be accessible.</p>
<h4 id="Postyarchiwalne-Open-source">Open-source</h4>
<p>At the point where we consider that the System Is Ready, we will make it available as open-source and allow <a href="https://www.jbison.com/" rel="nofollow">JBison</a> to be installed in closed environments. Without additional obligations.</p>
<h4 id="Postyarchiwalne-Afewwordsabouttechnologies">A few words about technologies</h4>
<p>Some people may be interested in how the system was written.<br><a href="https://www.jbison.com/" rel="nofollow">JBison</a> combines two IT worlds – Java EE 6, including the new CDI specification, and Ruby On Rails for the user interface.<br>Moreover we have been intensively using services such as Amazon’s cloud.<br>We would like to thank <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bobmcwhirter" rel="nofollow">Bob McWhirter</a> for the support we got for the platform he created, <a href="http://torquebox.org/" rel="nofollow">Torquebox</a>. Torquebox allows a RoR application to be deployed on the JBoss Application Server and provides an interface for easy communication of JavaEE with RoR (more on <a href="http://www.warski.org/blog/?p=245" rel="nofollow">Adam Warski’s blog</a>).<br>Interested?
