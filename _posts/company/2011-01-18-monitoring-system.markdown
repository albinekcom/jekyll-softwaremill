<p id="Postyarchiwalne-Attikisalarmmonitoringsystem">SoftwareMill’s cooperation of almost a year with Australian company Alexander Grange Ltd has resulted in the creation of the <a href="http://www.attikis.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Attikis</a> system. <a href="http://www.attikis.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Attikis</a> is a system for monitoring alarms in private homes and in companies. Using <a href="http://attikis.com/" rel="nofollow">Attikis</a> is very easy and allows significant savings to be made in comparison with traditional systems, and at the same time a high level of security is maintained in the premises it protects. The film below illustrates the system’s most important advantages.</p>
<p>The system is made up of two main parts: an online interface and a VoIP module. Through the online interface alarms are managed and the reaction procedures for alarms that have been activated are defined, e.g. sending an email or phoning a given number.</p>
<p>The VoIP module, operating under SIP protocol, allows for receiving and making telephone connections. Tone dialling (a solution often applied in IVR systems) and speech synthesis is also enabled. To produce the <a href="http://attikis.com/" rel="nofollow">Attikis</a> system we used many new solutions such as the CDI specification and the Mobicents platform for managing telephone connections.</p>
<p>Currently the system is only available to US residents, but please visit its website: <a href="http://www.attikis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.attikis.com</a><a href="http://www.attikis.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">.</a></p>
