<p id='Postyarchiwalne-Recordingof"RemoteProgrammer2.0"fromAgileCentralEurope2011'>We are happy to announce that a recording of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pawelwrzeszcz" rel="nofollow">Paweł Wrzeszcz’s</a> presentation on remote work from <a href="http://agilece.com/" rel="nofollow">Agile Central Europe 2011</a>, held in March/April in Cracow, is already online.</p>
<p>The presentation was largely based on experience of our day-to day (remote) work at SoftwareMill. If you are looking for answers concerning why working remotely is worth it, how to do it, and how to organise work in a distributed team, please have a look at the presentation video.</p>
