<p id="Postyarchiwalne-NewversionofCircular:theflexibledocumentmanagementsystem">We are proud to announce that from today the <a href="https://www.circular.pl/" rel="nofollow">Circular</a> document management system is available in a new version, allowing even more effective organisation of company document workflow and storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New, flexible approach</strong></p>
<p>Following our users’ suggestions, we decided that ease of organising documents is our priority – for example, to make an offer for an important client or a lost invoice easy to find later. At the same time, we wanted to create a system that would be as flexible as possible, adapting itself to each company’s operating culture.</p>
<p>The innovative solution applied in Circular is based on <em>tags</em>. Every file stored in the system can be labelled with any number of tags.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example – invoices</strong> </p>
<p>For instance, an invoice for the current month, to be settled within the “ABC” project run by the company may be tagged: “invoices”, “july”, “2011″, “ABC project” and “to be settled”.</p>

<p>Such a method of organising documents makes finding them again simple. With just a couple of clicks, we can get to files:</p>
<ul>
<li>connected with a particular project,</li>
<li>awaiting settlement,</li>
<li>for a particular month,</li>
<li>that are invoices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Queries can be combined however you want, which makes searching very flexible. For example, we can easily find invoices to be settled this July.</p>
<p>Thanks to tags, there will be no problem finding, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>an offer for a client sent out several months ago,</li>
<li>an important official certificate for the previous year,</li>
<li>a contract to be extended,</li>
<li>company presentations done by colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Everybody organises files how they want</strong></p>
<p>The advantage of the tag system in comparison with traditional catalogues is that you can file a document in many different ways. Individual employees who deal with different matters will have differing ways of classifying one same document that goes through their hands.</p>
<p>In Circular this is not a problem because each person can label a document the way that makes their work the easiest. People working with clients can view documents by projects or by clients, and accounting, by months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Try it out – we’re waiting for your suggestions</strong></p>
<p>We would love it if you tried out the new version of Circular and sent us your comments on the service’s functioning. The system is free for up to 5 users.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in suggestions on the flexible method of organising documents using tags.</p>
