<p id="Postyarchiwalne-Efficientandsecuredocumentworkflowwithtaggingsystem">Recently on the Circular blog we wrote about two elements that form the basis of effective processes in every company: efficient document workflow and document security.</p>
<p>The key to an efficient document workflow lies in individuals’ document management habits. Here are several easy ways that will help make life easier, both for you and for others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settle on one file naming system</li>
<li>Organise files by date</li>
<li>Keep related files together</li>
<li>Label versions clearly</li>
<li>Create copies of documents</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>More on the Circular blog: <a href="https://www.circular.pl/blog/?p=14000" rel="nofollow">How can I make document workflow in my company more efficient?</a></p>
<p>Research shows that Poles lose as much as PLN 13 billion a year through cybercrime. This is why ensuring the safety of company documents is particularly important. In this case, we can also recommend several basic procedures that should become the standard in every company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a safe password policy</li>
<li>Prepare an emergency plan</li>
<li>Encrypt confidential data</li>
<li>Manage access rights</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Modern document management systems allow document access rights to be defined very precisely, allowing you to reduce the risk of information leaks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply solutions adapted to new technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies need to accept the fact that employees use private phones or tablets for work purposes. This is why it is necessary to introduce precise document protection systems that fit the technologies used. Comprehensive systems that ensure security and, at the same time, help manage documents are the most cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>Data security in organisations is becoming a priority, and document management systems help achieve this objective without the need to spend additional funds or effort.</p>

<p>Circular combines efficient document workflow with the assurance that they will be securely stored and transferred. One of the innovative solutions making this possible is the document tagging system.</p>
<p>Tagging documents involves describing documents by assigning specific keywords to them. Instead of placing documents in subsequent folders, all you need to do is select the combination of keywords that will allow you to very quickly find the document in future.</p>
<p>Tags allow a document to be labelled with any combination of keywords. This is why they make very quick and intuitive searching for documents possible, without the need to remember the access path to their locations.</p>
<p>Additionally, they allow documents to be saved in several ways. This solves the eternal dilemma of whether to save invoices by date or by customer name.</p>
<p>Tags also open big opportunities, such as creating document workflow pathways. For example, an invoice can be tagged with the following keywords: annotated, accepted, settled – depending on the stage it is at.</p>
<p>See how tags work and why they are a better solution than folders: <a title="How to organise documents using keywords." href="https://www.circular.pl/blog/?p=14037" rel="nofollow">How to organise documents using keywords.</a></p>
<p>Circular is a document management system created by SoftwareMill, which allows efficient exchange, commenting and accepting of documents online.</p>
