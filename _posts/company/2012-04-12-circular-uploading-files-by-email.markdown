<p id="Postyarchiwalne-Circular:Uploadingfilesbyemail">There are many ways of uploading files to Circular. You can do it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>clicking the “Add file” button,</li>
<li>being assigned to a document by another user and…</li>
<li>sending an email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each document that is uploaded by email will be tagged automatically, without the need to make any changes in the system. All you need to do is send one or more documents as an email attachment to the email address of a tag.</p>
<p>The tag email address is very simple: the tag name, e.g. “cv”, the “@” sign, and your company address in Circular, e.g. “company.circular.pl”. So, if you want job applications to be tagged as “cv”, all you need to do is give potential employees the following email address: <a href="mailto:cv@firma.circular.pl" rel="nofollow">cv@firma.circular.pl</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to tag a document you are uploading to Circular with multiple tags. All you need to do is add a “+” sign between the names of the individual tags, and then the fixed part “@firma.circular.pl”.</p>
<p>You can use email to upload documents that can be edited (.doc, .xlsx, .odt, etc.) and those that can’t (.pdf, .jpg, .ovi, etc.), as well as .zip files.</p>
<p>Circular makes further document management easier by registering the history of documents from the moment they are added to the system. A document added by email will be tagged as such, and information about its sender (their email address) and the time it was sent will be available, while the contents of the email will show up as a comment.</p>
<p>This innovative function is fully compatible with the options previously offered by Circular, and completely free-of-charge within your selected subscription.</p>
