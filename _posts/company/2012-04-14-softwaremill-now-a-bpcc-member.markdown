<p id="Postyarchiwalne-SoftwareMillnowaBPCCmember">SoftwareMill has joined the <a title="www.bpcc.org.pl" href="http://www.bpcc.org.pl/" rel="nofollow">British-Polish Chamber of Commerce</a>, to strengthen its European position. The company believes the British market has big potential, as innovation and work performance there are very closely tied to IT systems.</p>
<p>SoftwareMill already has a very positive experience of cooperation in international projects together with a British partner. Moreover, through our partner and our English-speaking <a title="softwaremill.pl/zespol.html" href="http://softwaremill.pl/zespol.html" rel="nofollow">team</a>, our services are fully available to British clients.</p>
