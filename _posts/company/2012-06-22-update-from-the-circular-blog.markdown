<p align="JUSTIFY">Circular blog has recently covered the <strong>advantages of document management over simple file sharing</strong>. Efficient sharing drives productivity and improves operational capability. But for enterprises to build their competitive edge, there is a need for something more.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Companies need world-class systems for document management. Systems that support different operations on documents, but at the same time, are easy to implement, adjust and don’t require the engagement of technical department.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What is actually expected, when a company moves to a document management is the support within three areas. In terms of collaboration, there is a need for improving the processes connected with efficient feedback, creating versions, sharing and keeping copies of the documents. Identifying key documents should be supported by systems enabling using metadata for tagging and identifying documents, so that they are fully adjusted to the needs of particular organisation. And finally, document management should enable the control of the workflow, as well as managing access on every stage.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">DMS (document management system) implementation gives benefits within every area mentioned above, but is also a test for the efficiency of an organisation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To pass it, it’s worth thinking through some <strong>challenges connected with DMS implementation</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what documents to place in the DMS in advance </li>
<li>Manage the change and prepare employees for it</li>
<li>Introduce document management best practices </li>
<li>Give some time to yourself and others to get used to the new system</li>
<li>Look for support among executives</li>
</ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To gain most out of the DMS, it is essential to understand its key features, which enable to improve efficiency.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When it comes to Circular, one of them are <strong>states of documents</strong>, which enable to put the workflow in order.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each document in the system is assigned one of three states – categories. Each state defines the stage within the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awaiting – those are the documents that are not assigned to any user yet.</li>
<li>Assigned – documents, on which you are working.</li>
<li>Archived – place, where all documents to which you have access are stored: awaiting, assigned and archived.</li>
</ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This division also adds to an easier and faster document search, which is the main advantage of any document management system. Circular supports that, within every state, by using metadata i.e. <strong>tagging system</strong>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each document in Circular is marked with a particular combination of tags. For instance, an agreement might be tagged with such keywords as: agreements, March and John Brown, which enable for a very quick and effective search. To use tags, click on the button below the text box and choose the right combination of keywords. The documents list is being actualized instantly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Thanks to the states feature, it is possible to manage the workflow of documents according to the particular needs. While tagging system, enables quicker and more precise search.</p>
