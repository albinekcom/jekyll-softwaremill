<p>To celebrate the summer we are launching a new version of Circular. Updated version of the system includes new features and interface.<br> We did a thorough research about document management, which helped us in defining the changes we wanted to implement.<br> What, we found out, is that the most common thoughts connected with document management include:</p>
<ul>
<li>countless versions of the same document (60%)</li>
<li>problems with finding the latest version of the document (42%)</li>
<li>having to wait for every acceptance level (38%)</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why, our priority became to ensure maximum clarity of the interface and support the natural document workflow.</p>
<p> Structure of the system<br> We decided to introduce departments, which are a natural category for the documents. So within every department you might store different documents and define different tags. Thanks to that, number of documents that are displayed is reduced and the tag cloud is adjusted to the needs of particular department.</p>
<p> Managing the access<br> Introducing departments changed also the rules of granting the access. Now, access is granted together with the membership of particular department. Each department has not only its own name, but also users assigned, that can view and edit documents within that department. It’s the most simple and intuitive way that enables control of the access without any additional effort.</p>
<p> Support of the workflow<br> We decided to support the natural workflow by introducing the new navigation panel called expose. The panel enables to navigate easily between documents within the workflow.</p>
<p> It helps also to visualise the document workflow – from adding a document to the system, through assigning to a user, till the archiving. Each stage is represented by a particular icon and number of documents that are stored at that stage.</p>
<p>The aim of the new version was to increase the clarity of the interface and make the document workflow more intuitive.<br> You can check by yourself the new version of Circular by logging in to the system:</p>
