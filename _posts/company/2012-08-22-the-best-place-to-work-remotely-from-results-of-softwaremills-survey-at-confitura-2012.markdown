During the conference we carried out a survey asking the participants where they would like to work from if they were a part of SoftwareMill remote and dispersed <a title="meet our the SoftwareMill's Team" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/why-softwaremill/our-team" target="_blank">Team</a>. We received more than 250 answers. The diagram below shows some groups of similar answers.</p>

<p>According to the survey many of Polish Java developers would like to use the chance of working remotely while staying in the tropics (that is funny if you compare that result with <a title="read the post-Confitura 2012 comments" href="http://2012.confitura.pl/news/60/wasze_relacje_z_konferencji_i_ksiazki_do_wygrania" target="_blank">post-Confitura comments</a> where many of you complained about the heat at the conference <img alt=";)" src="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"> ) Quite many respondents would like to work from their home. In SoftwareMill it is the most common way of working from. There were also some original answers that our <a title="meet the SoftwareMill's Team" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/why-softwaremill/our-team" target="_blank">Team</a> liked a lot. SoftwareMill decided to fund a special price for the most original answer.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen the dialogue below that describes in the funniest way the best place for remote and distributed work. Just imagine the following situation:</p>
<p>- <em>Another one?</em> – scantily dressed waitress asks on the Hawaiian beach.</p>

<p>- <em>No thanks, I’m at work!</em></p>
<p>You may think this situation is far from reality, especially when the summer is coming to an end. Nothing could be more wrong!
