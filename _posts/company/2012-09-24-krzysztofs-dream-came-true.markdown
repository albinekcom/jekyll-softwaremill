<p>Do you remember <a title="The best place to work remotely from: Results of SoftwareMill’s survey at Confitura 2012" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/the-best-place-to-work-remotely-from-results-of-softwaremills-survey-at-confitura-2012">SoftwareMill’s survey</a> that we carried out at the <a title="SoftwareMill &amp; Confitura 2012 conference" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/softwaremill-confitura-2012-conference">Confitura 2012</a> conference? We asked participants where they would like to work from if they were a part of SoftwareMill remote and dispersed <a title="Our Experienced Team" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/why-softwaremill/our-team" target="_blank">Team</a>.</p>
<p>SoftwareMill decided to fund a special price for the most creative answer – a comfy bean bag pouffe. While exotic country was the most common idea, it was Krzysztof who won a competition by describing a <a title="The best place to work remotely from: Results of SoftwareMill’s survey at Confitura 2012" href="http://old.softwaremill.com/the-best-place-to-work-remotely-from-results-of-softwaremills-survey-at-confitura-2012" target="_blank">short conversation</a> that could happen on the place he would like to work from.</p>
<p>Now, Krzysztof’s dream to work from an exotic island came true! We have just received a message from Krzysztof. He and his comfy bean bag pouffe finally got to the exotic island! Just look below to see happy Krzysztof working remotely from the place he has always dreamt of.</p>
