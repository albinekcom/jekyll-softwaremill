<p>We proudly present AgileByExample conference that takes place this week – on the 4th and 5th October in Warsaw.</p>
<p>If you are in the developers’ or project management world, agile sounds familiar to you. And if you want to get to know the latest trends and hear from the most renowned experts in the field – you’d better not miss out on AgileByExample.</p>
<p>SoftwareMill is an organizer of this event for the second time already, as we firmly believe in agile and use it in our everyday work. We want to share our knowledge in this area and learn more from the best.</p>
