<p>Hey, want to meet people from Warsaw Java User Group and learn a lot in a fun way?</p>
<p>Next week (27th October) the 5th edition of Warsaw Java Workshops will take place and SoftwareMill is one of the sponsors.</p>
<p>The workshops is a one-day event, that provides Java programmers with hands-on learning in a wide range of topics from Agile and Scrum, through Software Craftsmanship, to Clojure, Scala, Groovy and JRuby.</p>
<p>The idea is to learn by doing and solving problems as an opposite to the most events for programmers that are usually conferences filled with theoretical presentations.</p>
<p><a href="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-19-at-9.54.17-AM.png"><img title="Screen Shot 2012-10-19 at 9.54.17 AM" alt="" src="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-19-at-9.54.17-AM.png" width="234" height="193"></a></p>
<p>We also prepared a workshop based on our experience in agile projects, which is called ‘One day with a difficult client’.</p>
<p>It’s a game about managing clients’ relations in an agile project. The game is based on a particular case study and will enable participants to walk through a project and face the most common traps connected with a client. After the workshop we will cover the most common mistakes, that we’ve also made while running a wide range of projects for clients from the US, Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>The event is free, but you need to sign up for it here: <a href="http://warszawa.jug.pl/warsjawa-2012">http://warszawa.jug.pl/warsjawa-2012</a></p>
<p>See you at the event!</p>
