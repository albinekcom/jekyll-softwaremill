<p>For those who haven’t been, those who are considering attending the conference next year and those curious – we’ve prepared a coverage of the most interesting aspects of Devoxx 2012.</p>
<p>In this part you can read stories by: <a href="https://twitter.com/szimano">TomekSz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jkijanowski">Jarek</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TomaszDziurko">TomekD</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Probably the best Devoxx I went to, so far.</p>
<p>This year was hugely influenced by the new, cool DIY electronic components – RaspberryPis, Arduino etc. The coolest thing I saw, was that JavaFX will come to RaspberryPI and will be able to render cool, hardware accelerated GUI apps without any X server whatsoever. Gonna be really cool to code against it.</p>
<p>Lots of HTML5, heavier and heavier utilisation of cloud services – I guess the programs have officially left of workstations.</p>
<p>Few things definitely worth noticing – OpenShift – RedHat’s cloud service. Vert.x – Tim Fox’s framework for building highly scalable, polyglot applications (JEE-free). Also a very interesting presentation on security in HTML5.</p>
<p>For the not-so-good – Javaposse wasn’t funny (making jokes about Gulags… really? why don’t you guys joke about concentration camps ?).</p>
<p>And the ultimate travel trip – If you are ever in Charleroi – make sure to check out Taverne Sainte Barbe on Place Charles II. Very good vibe, very good beer and outstanding chef serving best T-Bones ever (someone who “knew” english called it Ribs, but still was worth every eurocent ).</p>
<p>Definitely see you next year.</p>

<p>I promised myself… to not go to Devoxx this year. However it was a great opportunity to get some social life <img alt=";)" src="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"></p>
<p>I promised myself… not to leave out any presentation. However I really had to stand up and go during the talks about The JBoss Polyglot Revolution and Closures and Collections.</p>
<p>I promised myself… not to go to the JavaPosse show… and I did it again.. unfortunately…</p>
<p>All in all it was very well spent time for me. The most interesting presentations were hold during the last day. Although the party @ the Noxx was terrific and therefore long, I made it to the first talk next day! Kudos to myself <img alt=";)" src="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"> “Cloud Robotics” was about moving CPU intensive computations, that is needed to turn some piece of metal into a real functional robot, to the cloud. Nice concept, nice talk. Pity pity there was no real robot available on stage.</p>
<p>Then it was time for building awesome desktop applications. And as usual, after a JavaFX talk, I cannot await to give it some love.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Adam Bien gave a talk about Real World JEE development. Was fun and exactly what I needed to have a good impression about the whole conference. This is it… well, almost! There was this farewell evening in Charleroi @ Taverne Sainte Barbe… he he he <img alt=":)" src="http://old.softwaremill.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"></p>
<p>P.S. What happened in the Noxx, stays in the Noxx.</p>

<p>The more conferences you attend, the less completely new stuff you are able to learn from such events. But Devoxx is somehow different, it lets you see some trends in languages that becoming mainstream, tools that are gaining popularity and also more general approaches to solving our developers’ daily problems. And this year was not different.</p>
<p>As usual we were encouraged by guys from Oracle to try JavaFX. But at last this platform and whole ecosystem around it looks really mature and very, very promising. It would be very exciting to try it with real project as what we saw during talks was very convincing.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is a noticeable shift from Java web frameworks to JavaScript in front-end. Rooms during talks about testing in JS, AngularJS and Javascript for Java Developers were really crowded. For most of Java developers it became clear that JS is a better tool to deal with browser and we should add this language to our toolbox as soon as it is possible.</p>
<p>From other areas, it looks like Scala is now a dominant winner as a second language on JVM Platform as there were quite a lot talks about this topic and they were more advanced than I expected. So generally we, as a Java developers, are supposed to know something about Scala and if you don’t, you should choose it as a language for your next pet project to play with.</p>
<p>And last thing, beers in Belgium were great as usual They have plenty different kinds to choose from and each comes with special glass which makes socialising with other Devoxxians even more exceptional.</p>
