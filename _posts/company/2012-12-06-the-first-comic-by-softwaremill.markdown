<p>Today in Poland it’s the Day of Santa Claus – children receive small gifts and we have also prepared something for you ☺</p>
<p>It’s a comic about a developer in Central-East Europe – Millkovsky and his colleague implementing Scrum.</p>
<p>We hope it will start a nice series, so let us know what do you think about it and what could Millkovsky be doing in the next parts.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
