<p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment...</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-133"></a></p>
<p>So blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>

<p>Last weekend the majority of the team went on a trip to Berlin, as a form of our monthly company meeting.</p>
<p>We wanted to visit our CTO, Adam Warski, who moved there temporarily, attend some interesting events and of course simply enjoy beer and kebabs together.</p>
<p>The trip started on Friday afternoon on the train in Warsaw. Several people joined us along the way and the rest of the team met us in Berlin. Our key finding: travelling by train is a great opportunity to hash out all the things we don’t usually have time for. It’s a comfortable place, sometimes without wi-fi, with good food (yes, restaurants on Polish trains are really great) that makes everyone want to chat for hours.</p>

<p>In Berlin, we discovered a great pub with self-served beer and a gamified experience. Every table had a system for pouring the beer and screens to record the amount everyone at the table had drunk. A big screen on the wall showed how much beer had been drunk at each table not only in Berlin, but also in other Czech, Austrian and German bars. And guess what? SoftwareMill was the winner, of course.</p>

<p>We also did some sightseeing together and saw the most important places in Berlin. Despite it being really insanely cold (no, there are no polar bears in Poland and we are not used to such temperatures ;) ) we had lots of fun, as you can see in the pictures.</p>

<p>Some of us attended very interesting events during the stay. We went to the ‘Crossing the chasm’ Berlin TechMeetup which was held in Betahaus, a coworking space popular among startups. There were presentations by SoundCloud, 6Wunderkinder and orderbird.</p>
<p>We also took part in MongoDBDays – with Adam speaking about MongoDB-based queuing and messaging systems.</p>
<p>Generally, we had lots of fun, and some even called this trip our best weekend/meetup ever. We really recommend such trips as a natural way of bringing dispersed teams together.</p>
<p>And what are your best company meetups? Any particular places, activities?</p>
