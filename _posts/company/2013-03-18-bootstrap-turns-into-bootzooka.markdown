<p>New name of our open source project has just arrived!</p>
<p>Some time ago, we asked you to help us come up with a new name for our open source project, called ‘Bootstrap’ at the time.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a showcase application which can be used as a starting point for the development of any real application.</p>
<p>We got some very interesting suggestions and have finally picked the new name and the winner of the contest.</p>
<p>The new name for our project is ‘Bootzooka’, and was suggested by one of us – <a href="https://twitter.com/Zuchos">Łukasz Żuchowski</a>.  It got the most votes from our team members.</p>
<p>In second place we have ‘Yeast’, submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/travelsome">Anton Bagchi</a>, who is the winner of the contest. So the prize, this great T-shirt with the hero of our comic, Millkovski, goes to Anton – congratulations!</p>

<p>A BIG thanks to all of you who participated in the contest.  There will definitely be more opportunities in the future to win this kind of T-shirt, as we know that some of you liked it a lot.</p>
<p>By the way, you can read an update about Bootzooka here: <a href="http://softwaremill.com/bootstrap-iteration-10-angular-usage-improvements-rogue">softwaremill.com/bootstrap-iteration-10</a></p>
<p>We also encourage you to use the app, and even better, to contribute to its development.</p>
