<p>You’ve probably been wondering what’s going on with Millkovsky, as we haven’t published any new stories for a while.</p>
<p>Well, actually, we hadn’t heard from him for quite a long time either… We were really curious what he had been doing all this time.</p>
<p>Then somebody sent us that picture of Millkovsky at the post office. Remember?</p>

<p>So, now everything is clear. Just read the comic and you will understand…</p>
<p>Hope you have fun!</p>
