<p>Last weekend we took part in <a href="http://2013.devcrowd.pl/">DevCrowd</a>, a conference organized by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/szczecinjug/">Szczecin Java Users Group</a>.<br> First of all, big kudos to the organizers, especially our own <a href="https://twitter.com/pawelstawicki">Paweł Stawicki</a>, for making such a great conference happen!<br> We were really happy to contribute to the event, whose motto was: ‘Share your knowledge and passion’.</p>

<p>It inspired us to come up with a programming challenge that let us share our knowledge and passion for Scala. The challenge was a kind of contest for all the participants. We announced it just after the opening ceremony and people had a whole day to find the solution.</p>
<p>The task was implementing a very simple function using Scala to help Rob the Robot reach the top of a ladder in space. Go check out the task if you’re interested!</p>
<p>While many implementations were plain and simple, the contest winner, Oskar Strączkowski, prepared a not-naive implementation, which tried to have Rob take the biggest possible jumps – for that, let’s give him a big round of applause! <img alt=":-)" src="http://softwaremill.pl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"> The prize was really well-deserved. Oskar is now the owner of an interactive game system – Sifteo cubes.</p>
<p>Apart from the contest, we’ve our team members had two presentations.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/ktosopl">Konrad Malawski</a> spoke about Scalding and <a href="https://twitter.com/lukaszlenart">Łukasz Lenart</a> presented on the security of web frameworks.</p>
<p>You can view the presentations here:<br><a href="http://softwaremill.pl/www.slideshare.net/ktoso/scalding-hadoop-word-count-in-less-than-60-lines-of-code">www.slideshare.net/ktoso</a><br><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kravietz/struts2-howsecure">www.slideshare.net/kravietz</a></p>
<p>The team really enjoyed the conference and we’re already looking forward to next year’s!</p>
