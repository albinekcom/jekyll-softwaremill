<p>At SoftwareMill we really love taking part in conferences. It’s about meeting new people, getting lots of food for thought and probably the best part – having lots and lots of great talks with other participants and speakers.</p>
<p>Few weeks ago, as we were talking about going to GeeCON – one of the biggest Java conferences in Central-East Europe, we thought – what if we could expand the experience? What if we start the conference already on a train?</p>
<p>And that’s how the idea of GeeCON Train emerged.</p>
<p>We are starting the conference with a before-event on a train from Warsaw to Krakow.</p>
