<p>It’s a BIG day for us as we launch our new website and completely new identity. Here comes the brand new SoftwareMill!</p>
<p>Although we do feel nostalgic about the old logo and website we also feel it’s time to move on. Especially as we’ve gone through some serious changes over the past months.</p>
</div>
<figure><img src="https://softwaremill.com/img/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-09-at-4.12.18-PM-e1368457748741.png" alt="Brand NEW SoftwareMill"></figure><div class="text">
<p>First of all, we’ve grown a bit and there are now 21 of us, with five new people who have joined the team only this year.</p>
<p>Secondly, we’ve built long-term relationships with most of our clients and are expanding to new markets starting with Germany.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we are developing <a href="http://www.codebrag.com">Codebrag</a> – a tool for code reviews, which has already gathered very warm feedback. We will be launching the beta soon.</p>
<p>Finally, we are expanding the AgilebyExample formula – in addition to the big event in October, a mini-conference is being organised every few months.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we are stepping into the SML2.0 era, which means serious organisational changes. But this is a story for another time…</p>
<p>As you can see, quite a lot has happened recently and we wanted those changes to be reflected in our identity. We’ve gone through the challenging process of rebranding – BIG thanks to <a href="http://www.balsamstudio.com">Balsam Studio</a> for all the support!</p>
<p>What was our aim? We wanted to express the uniqueness of SoftwareMill, which operates globally, consists of real passionates and is active in so many communities. Also, we wanted to show that back-end (Java &amp; Scala), in which we specialize, is just as fun and exciting as lighter technologies ;)</p>
<p>We hope we have achieved it at least to some extent.</p>
<p>The website is in English only and we concentrated on a single (.com) domain, as the vast majority of our visitors come from abroad.</p>
<p>At this point, also a BIG thanks to all our team for their input and patience during the process :)</p>

<p>So just before <a href="http://2013.geecon.org">GeeCON</a>, along with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geecon-train">GeeCON Train</a> taking off, we’re proud to launch this website. We encourage you to dive into it, as you will probably learn new things about us. Also, do try to get to the non-obvious parts ;)</p>
<p>We are curious to know what you think about it.</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
