<p>One of our clients is an US startup developing music and TV discovery apps that demonstrate social entertainment engagement.</p>
<p>The project is really interesting and we’ve been developing highly scalable back-end APIs for their mobile apps for almost two years.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>Recently, we’ve received references for it and we are really happy to share them:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em> ”Software Mill helps us pull off the impossible — in record time! </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Their development team is smart, fast and collaborative. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>They work seamlessly with our mobile development and design teams to power the highly-scalable, back end APIs for our industry leading iOS and mobile web apps.”</em></span></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every now and then, we are approached by companies developing mobile apps that are in the need of highly scalable back-end. We totally recommend using Scala for that.</p>
<p>Get in touch with us and we are ready to share our best practices in this subject! </p>
