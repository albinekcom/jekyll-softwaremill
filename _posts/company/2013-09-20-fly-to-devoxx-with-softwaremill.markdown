<p>Remember how SoftwareMill organised the <a title="GeeCON Train – the coolest way to get to a conference" href="https://softwaremill.com/geecon-train-the-coolest-way-to-get-to-a-conference/">GeeConTrain</a> to Cracow last spring, and the <a title="Confitura bus" href="https://softwaremill.com/confitura-bus-2013/">ConfituraBus</a> to Spoina, the conference after-party in the summer? </p>
<p>This autumn we would love you to join in our new initiative — DevoxxPlane! </p>
<p><strong>What’s it all about?</strong></p>
<p>Getting to Devoxx takes a while — time that can be used by Polish programmers going to the conference for integration. This year, 7 people from SoftwareMill will be going to Devoxx. We attend the event regularly, so we would be very happy to share our experience from previous years, introduce you round, organise a night out with the best beer and steaks in Antwerp and generally talk about all interesting subjects that come up. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the plan?</strong> </p>
<p>We suggest flying together from Warsaw to Brussels, and then getting to Antwerp by bus/train. We have also chosen a hotel to stop at and asked Charles at the local bar to have some cold beer waiting for us. </p>
<p><strong>Join us!</strong> </p>
