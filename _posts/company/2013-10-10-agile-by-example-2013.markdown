For the third time already, we are organizing one of the greatest events for the agile community in Poland – [AgileByExample](http://2013.agilebyexample.com/).
This time we’ve decided to make the event even bigger to increase its impact. Our aim is to provide the community with an opportunity to meet up, learn from the best experts in the world and get that boost of energy which makes us so passionate about agile.
 
This wouldn’t be possible if it weren't for help from our friends, Touk, who joined us this year as co-organizer. Thanks guys for your great work!




Together our goal was to make ABE13 special and here is what we’ve accomplished:
 
**Superstar speakers**
 
We are really proud of the speakers’ league that will be presenting this year. Just to start with, our great keynote speakers: Jeff Sutherland (one of the creators of Scrum) and Jurgen Appelo (well-known agile coach and blogger).
 
Check out all the speakers here: [2013.agilebyexample.com/speakers](http://2013.agilebyexample.com/speakers/). 
 
**Dojo**
 
As AgileByExample is about learning by doing, we’ve decided to organize a workshop day on the third day of the conference. It’s a great opportunity to practice what you learned during the conference.
 
**Almost 300 participants**
 
Finally, this time almost 300 people will take part in our agile event. There will be 25 speakers, over 10 organizers and 265 participants.




We hope you will have a really great time, and get lots of inspiration and new agile skills!
See you there!
