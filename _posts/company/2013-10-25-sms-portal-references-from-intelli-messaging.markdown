One of our clients for whom we are developing a high-throughput SMS gateway was so kind to share the following opinion about working with us: 


> I am very satisfied with the development service you and your team have provided and would be happy to recommend you service to others.
> 
> With a very difficult development task with some very high benchmarks SoftwareMill has delivered a great result and done so very cost effectively.
> 
> Not only are you expert developers with an extra-ordinary knowledge in Enterprise Java, but also very good at planning and executing the development requirements while keeping to the agile development methodology.
> Your team also has the, rare ability for developers, to get a strong and clear understanding of the reasoning for the functional requirements to point that you pick up early the mistakes and inconsistencies that we as the customer often make.
