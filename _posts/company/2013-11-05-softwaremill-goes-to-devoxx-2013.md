It is almost a tradition that a large representation from our company attends 
[Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.be/#/), the biggest Java conference in Europe.

This year we are going with a strong team of 7 people 
(Maciek, 
[Jarek](https://twitter.com/jkijanowski), 
[Jacek](https://twitter.com/rucek), 
[Paweł](https://twitter.com/pawelstawicki), 
[Tomek](https://twitter.com/szimano), 
[Adam](https://twitter.com/adamwarski) and
[Łukasz](https://twitter.com/zuchos)), 
joined by some friends from the Warsaw JUG and others. (So expect an even larger 
Polish representation!)

Let us know if you'd like to:

&#8608; talk about [CodeBrag](http://www.codebrag.com/)

&#8608; get a "I'm proud of my code" sticker (we'll have "I'm proud ..." or the colorful
"Chrum" t-shirts)

&#8608; find out more about SoftwareMill and how it is to work at a 
[fully distributed company](https://softwaremill.com/20-ceos-in-one-company/)

&#8608; chat about any of the technologies we are using (Scala, Akka, Java) (or
anything technology-related, in fact).


Moreover, I'll be giving two presentations at the conference:

####[ElasticMQ: a fully asynchronous, Akka-based Amazon SQS server](http://www.devoxx.be/dv13-adam-warski.html?presId=3127)

(Wednesday, 13:10-13:25, Room 9) 
The quickie will be an introduction to using ElasticMQ when testing
applications which leverage SQS. We'll also see how to implement a fast http service using 
Spray, Akka and Scala without a single blocking operation, and take a look at some
helpful constructs and patterns.

####[The ideal module system and the harsh reality](http://www.devoxx.be/dv13-adam-warski.html?presId=3126)

(Wednesday, 17:50-18:50, Room 9) 
We'll go through some of the core properties that we might
want a good module system to have, and shortly see how current solutions corresponds
to these requirements. We'll also take a closer look at java packages, their
relation to module systems, and how we can improve modularity of our code today
using Veripacks or Ceylon.

See you on Devoxx!

Adam
