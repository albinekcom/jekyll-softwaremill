We are happy to announce that [SoftwareMill](https://softwaremill.com) signed a consulting partnership agreement with [Typesafe, Inc](http://typesafe.com/).

Typesafe is dedicated to helping developers build Reactive applications on the JVM. With the Typesafe Reactive Platform, including [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/), [Akka](http://akka.io/), and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), developers can deliver highly responsive user experiences backed by a resilient and event-driven application stack that scales effortlessly on multicore and cloud computing architectures.

SoftwareMill has been a long-time Scala user. Starting with a single Scala-based system, over the course of three years, a majority of projects delivered by SoftwareMill are now written using Scala and Akka. We also have experience with the [Spray](http://spray.io/) toolkit (first deployment to production was 2 years ago), which has been recently announced to form the basis of the new Akka HTTP module. Moreover, SoftwareMill actively participates in the Scala community, e.g. by running open-source projects ([Bootzooka](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka), [ElasticMQ](https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq), [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire)).

We would also like to take this opportunity to invite you to [Scalar](http://scalar-conf.com/), a free-to-attend, one-day Scala conference in Warsaw, Poland, which will take place this Spring.
