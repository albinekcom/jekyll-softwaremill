Are you going to GeeCon 2014? From Warsaw? Why not do it like a proper engineer? That is, arrive aboard tons of hardened steel rushing at 160 kilometres per hour? And have a 3+ hours of exciting discussions? 

If your answer to the above question is yes, then wait no longer and enlist for the [GeeCon Train 2014](http://www.meetup.com/geecon-train/events/173487602/), a SoftwareMill co-ordinated GeeCon 2014 brain transfer from Warsaw To Krakow.

It's simple - you just let us know that you want to come, we coordinate a batch ticket purchase and make sure all Java people are in the same train compartments.


We also provide some nice surprise for all the participants. Geecon Train leaves on May 13th's evening, so you can board it straight after work. See you there!
