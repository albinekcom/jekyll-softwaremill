Scalar was the first Scala conference in Central Europe. And one that, despite it being the first edition, went great. 

Firstly, we'd like to thank all of you, the speakers and participants, for coming! There were around 300 people in total, coming from Poland, Germany, Austria, Great Britain, Slovenia and other countries. Scalar is made by Scala people for Scala people - and we've all proved it!

Secondly, thanks for taking part in our feedback survey - as for the best three talks, the winners are: Simple, Fast, Agile REST with Spray.io by Adam Warski, The Dark Side of Scala by Tomasz Nurkiewicz and Lamda Implementation in Scala 2.11 and Java 8 by Grzegorz Kossakowski. 

As for the rest of the survey results, there were 126 replies in total, we'll provide a weighted average of the answers (where 5 - awesome, 1 - bad): 

**Speaker lineup**: Awesome 23%, Okay 58%, Normal 10%, Could be better 8%, Bad 2%

**Venue**: Awesome 27%, Okay 60%, Normal 8%, Could be better 5%, Bad 0%

**Scalar in 2015?**: Yes, very much! 67%, Yes 21%, Maybe 9%, Rather not	2%, No 1%


We've received much **attention from bloggers**: Sebastian Gębski wrote about [Scalar from a .NET dev perspective][1], Jacek Laskowski [wanted Scalar to last longer][2], Paweł Włodarski went to [Scalar not to become a Scala fanatic][3], [Szymon Stępniak and Toruń JUG representation were also present][4]. Tomek Kaczmarczyk claims [travelling 12 hours was worth it][5], Tomek Pewinski wanted to check how does [Scala community in Poland look like][6] and, finally, TeamStatus seem [not to really like Scala very much after Scalar][7]

If that's still not enough, why not take a look at the [photos by Andrzej Goławski][8]. Plus, we'll compile and share the talks soon!

Thanks once again! Keep on scaling!
