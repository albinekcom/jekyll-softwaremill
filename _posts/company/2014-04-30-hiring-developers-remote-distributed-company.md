Working remotely means hiring remotely. Not an easy feat, to be honest. Thus, we decided to write an overview of our approach to hiring - just to save you hassle. You can treat this post as a loose recipe - I'll try to tuck in as little marketing fluff as possible.

##The Approach##

Would you board a plane running on your code? What coding mistake would make you cut that programmer's fingers off? Why bugs happen?

Don't worry, those are the most abstract questions we sometimes ask during the pre-final interview. We want to hire brilliant people - conference and meetup leaders, open source contributors and bloggers - in short, people who think independently. And can work in a team. 
 

##The Method##

Disclaimer: we don't have HR. Anyone willing and experienced enough can take part in the recruiting process and decision making.

Firstly, we play fair. After we accept your CV and like your reason to work at SoftwareMill, you get a short survey. It's quite general (soft/hard skills & motivations) but also explains all the steps of the recruitment process - we don't dabble in the horrible "We'll call you later." practice. All the steps in the process are atomic - the candidate may drop out after every single one, but always gets a notification. Because we play fair.

Next, there's a short Skype/mobile talk that basically makes sure you can communicate. After which you get a short programming task you set the deadline for; the code review of the task is multi-layered and involves us sending you questions concerning the code. 

This task is followed by a longer (1-1,5h) technical call with two of our programmers. Finally, we invite you to a lunch during which we confirm you are a human being and decide whether we really think we can learn from you. We don't require any sort of formal attire, especially if it's hot. And that's it! You'll probably drop in to our monthly company meetup and down some beers with us. 


##The Results##

Surprisingly, most people drop out because of... inactivity. They don't finish their programming tasks. 
The very solution of the task is the next culprit, as well as the longer technical call. But all in all, we take aboard around 25% of the applicants. Plus, the recruited become the recruiters - you immediately gain access to our wiki, where you can check out your entire recruitment history and/or help the current recruitment party do their awesome job.

##Should You do it?##

We're proud of our recruitment system and greatly recommend it, not only for remote & distributed companies. We tell the applicant that we respect them and that it's only their skills and attitude that matter. And every single one of our developers is able to succesfuly start and lead a product from ground up.

The only problem is that we hear about people not applying to SoftwareMill because... we're too good. We were called the Polish Google or programming heavy-lifters. We think that if you've got doubts about your skills then it's a good sign. Because you're humble. And humility is what every interview starts with - on both sides.
