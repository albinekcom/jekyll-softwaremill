Retrospectives are so easy. 

You just sit in a room, draw on a whiteboard, think what went bad, what went wrong and then go for a pizza. Piece of cake.

Providing you're in the same office. 

It's trickier when working in a remote & distributed company. And no, Skype doesn't cut it. You need good tools (which, surprisingly, mirror the real-life accessories) and a healthy attitude - after all, a good review isn't about praising everyone involved. Plus, it's way easier to be misunderstood via video&voice chat than face-to-face. 

However, even if you're not remote/distributed, knowing how to do remote retrospectives might be a good skill to have. Just imagine an obligatory on-site client work. Or branching out to a different country. Not to mention better commnication!

Just as with our [remote hiring recipe](https://softwaremill.com/hiring-developers-remote-distributed-company/) or [communication tool post](https://softwaremill.com/skype-hipchat-slack-quest), it's a loose guide - hope you'll find it useful!
Here's how we do retrospectives at [SoftwareMill](http://softwaremill.com).

##Draw away with Cosketch

The retrospectives sometimes look a bit like this:

<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">
<img src="/img/uploads/2014/06/retrospectivepost1.png"/>
</div>

Free online whiteboard, runs without registration and works in your browser with no extra plugins. Lots of space for mindstorming and taking notes straight on the whiteboard. Plus, you can use the time saved by no setup for doodles. 

It isn't all fine & dandy, though - Cosketch doesn't look very professional and has some synchronisation issues, it might also not be clear for outside people; is the picture above a part of the retrospective or a loose doodle? 

Sometimes we use [Twiddla](http://www.twiddla.com/) instead. 

#On board with [IdeaBoardz](ideaboardz.com)

<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">
<img src="/img/uploads/2014/06/retrospectivepost2.png"/>
</div>

We used to do corking retrospectives with Corkboards, but they're down. IdeaBoardz is a skeuomorphic (remember the craze?) simple management tool. Like, really simple. It can choke during bigger retros - after all, how many sticky cards can you cram into a whiteboard? Be aware that there's only a handful of features.

##Hack away with [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com)/Google Docs

Those two tools are more-or-less the same when having a text retro. Hackpad is more for real-time collaboration, however *everyone* has google account with google drive and, subsequently, docs. Pros: easy and clear to use. Cons: May be less informative than colourful cards or fancy drawings.

#The obvious [Trello](http://trello.com)

<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">
<img src="/img/uploads/2014/06/retrospectivepost3.png"/>
</div>

Of course, you can use any single project management tool to do retrospectives - just create a new board and retrospect! The only possible drawback we can think of is the lack of easy export of retro results. Or, well, clutter - providing you've got lots of boards in your organisation.

====Koniec/Napisać coś o tym, jak robimy retro?*=====

* jeśli jest co pisać, bo widzę, że każdy zespół robi to chyba w inny sposób, aczkolwiek myslałem napisać o (oczywistych dla nas) rzeczach w stylu: jawne retro dla całej organizacji - wszystko na kiwi, małe action items, jakieś pomysły?
