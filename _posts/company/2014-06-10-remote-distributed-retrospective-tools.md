Retrospectives are so easy. 

You just sit in a room, draw on a whiteboard, think what went bad, what went wrong and then go for a pizza. Piece of cake.

Providing you're in the same office. 

It's trickier when working in a remote & distributed company. And no, Skype doesn't cut it. You need good tools (which, surprisingly, mirror the real-life accessories) and a healthy attitude - after all, a good review isn't about praising everyone involved. Plus, it's way easier to be misunderstood via video&voice chat than face-to-face. 

However, even if you're not remote/distributed, knowing how to do remote retrospectives might be a good skill to have. Just imagine an obligatory on-site client work. Or branching out to a different country. Not to mention better commnication!

Just as with our [remote hiring recipe](https://softwaremill.com/hiring-developers-remote-distributed-company/) or [communication tool post](https://softwaremill.com/skype-hipchat-slack-quest), it's a loose guide - hope you'll find it useful!

But firstly - why do them at all?

##Why retrospectives matter?

Retrospectives are 100% agile - and not just for the buzzword's sake; doing frequent retros is just common sense. Well, a least if you want to learn from your mistakes. Because we'll probably always make them - the retros just help us make them less often.

Secondly, it's also about team building. We believe that a good team is able to say "We botched this work, sorry." *but also* "We really pulled this one off, great!". And that's priceless when working in a remote environment. 

Not to mention that the air is way clearer after a frank, open retro. Let's see the tools!

##Draw away with [Cosketch](http://cosketch.com),[Twiddla](http://www.twiddla.com/)

The retrospectives sometimes look a bit like this:

</div>

Online whiteboards work very well for mindstorming, taking notes and, are, erm, entertainment. For example, one of our teams drew a motorbike and adorned it with the things that "propel" them. Plus, no formatting whatsoever limits your thoughts.

**Pros**:

* - Colour variety (one for each team member)
* - You can really draw something (instead of describing it)
* - Changes stored in the history and "undo" is available

<br />
**Cons**:

* - May seem too complicated
* - Doesn't look nice & organised
* - Some synchronisation problems

<br />
Drawing might need some discipline or using another tool in order to present the retrospective's results in a clear way. Just think - is the picture above a part of the retrospective or a loose doodle? 

##On board with [IdeaBoardz](http://ideaboardz.com), [Trello](http://trello.com)

IdeaBoardz is a skeuomorphic (remember the craze?) simple management tool. Like, really simple. It can choke during bigger retros - after all, how many sticky cards can you cram into a whiteboard? IdeaBoardz has got very few features besides sticky cards, though.

We use Trello because we like it, but you can use any single project management tool to do retrospectives - just create a new board and retrospect! The only possible drawback we can think of is the lack of easy export of retro results. Or, well, clutter - providing you've got lots of boards in your organisation.

##Document sharing with [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com), [Google Docs](http://drive.google.com)

Quite similiar tools, though Hackpad is more for real-time collaboration. On the other hand, almost *everyone* has google account with google drive and, subsequently, docs. 


**Pros**: 

* - Very useful when writing down action points (Google Docs)
* - You see clearly who wrote what (Hackpad)

<br />
**Cons**:

* - May be less informative than cards or drawings
* - Sharing isn't exactly flawless (Google Docs)

<br />

##So, how's your retro today?
