We're sponsoring Build Stuff 2014! Two of SoftwareMill's founders - [Adam Warski](http://twitter.com/adamwarski) & [Tomek Szymański](http://twitter.com/szimano) and our hiring specialist [Tomek Dziurko](http://twitter.com/tomaszdziurko) will be there, eager to share their knowledge. Be sure to come over and say hi!

Or... you could ask them about our [flat structure](https://softwaremill.com/20-ceos-in-one-company/), [remoteness](https://softwaremill.com/remote-workers-do-actually-work/) or [the hiring process](https://softwaremill.com/hiring-developers-remote-distributed-company/). Or the 3DP/Raspberry Pi/iOS/Android project for the Confitura conference (pisze sie). We've got lots of knowledge to share, just find us and say hello.

We're also going to have company stand with deployed instances of [Codebrag](http://codebrag.com), our code review tool for agile teams - be sure to come over and give it a go! 

You'll be able to talk with its creators and learn how to do smooth, effective code reviews without complicating the process. There'll be a special surprise contest, too, but, well, it's a secret of course.

See you there!
