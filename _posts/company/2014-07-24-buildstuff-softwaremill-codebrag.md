We're sponsoring [Build Stuff 2014](http://buildstuff.lt/)! Two of SoftwareMill's founders - [Adam Warski](http://twitter.com/adamwarski) & [Tomek Szymański](http://twitter.com/szimano) and our hiring specialist [Tomek Dziurko](http://twitter.com/tomaszdziurko) as well as our frontline devs: [Krzysiek Ciesielski](https://twitter.com/kpciesielski) and [Paweł Stawicki](https://twitter.com/pawelstawicki) will be there, eager to share their knowledge. 
Make sure to come over and say hi!

Or... you could ask them about our [flat structure](https://softwaremill.com/20-ceos-in-one-company/), [remoteness](https://softwaremill.com/remote-workers-do-actually-work/) or [the hiring process](https://softwaremill.com/hiring-developers-remote-distributed-company/). We've got lots of knowledge to share, just find us and say hello.

We're also going to have the [Codebrag](http://codebrag.com) stand, our recently open-sourced code review tool for agile teams - be sure to come over and give it a go! 

See you there!
