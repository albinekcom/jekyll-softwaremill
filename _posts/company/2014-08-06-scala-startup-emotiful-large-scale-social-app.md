Seems like scaling startups is all the rage lately - after all, you need more than MVP to accomodate a growing userbase.

Such is the case with [Emotiful](http://app.emotiful.com), an emerging social app, [a new addition to our portfolio](https://softwaremill.com/portfolio/#emotiful). Emotiful approached us with a huge challenge - scaling their image tagging startup.

Firstly, we had to optimize the database brimming with users. Next, we moved the infrastructure from Mongolab to [AWS](https://softwaremill.com/aws-consulting/), including automatization via Chef. Finally, we've added push notifications, Twitter integrations, an activity log and a few other features, with continuous support & maintenance. 

This is yet another case of SoftwareMill scaling a startup - take a look at [the Yap.TV story](https://softwaremill.com/scaling-ruby-scala-yap-reactive-platform/), with media discovery app moving from Ruby to Scala. 

Seems like something you'd need doing? [Let us know](http://softwaremill.com/contact)!
