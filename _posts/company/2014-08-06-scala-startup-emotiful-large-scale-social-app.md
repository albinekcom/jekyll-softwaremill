Seems like scaling startups is all the rage lately - after all, you need more than MVP to accomodate a growing userbase.

Such is the case with [Emotiful](http://app.emotiful.com), an emerging social app, [a new addition to our portfolio](https://softwaremill.com/portfolio/#emotiful). Emotiful approached us with a huge challenge - scaling their image tagging startup.

Firstly, we had to optimize the database brimming with images. Next, we moved the infrastructure from Mongolab to [AWS](https://softwaremill.com/aws-consulting/), including automatization via Chef. 

After the optimization phase, we've added push notifications, Twitter integration, an activity log and a few other features like rich Facebook story posting and guest mode (which you can experience at [app.emotiful.com](http://app.emotiful.com)). Support & maintenance included. 

This is yet another case of SoftwareMill scaling a startup - we also took care of scaling [Yap.TV](https://softwaremill.com/scaling-ruby-scala-yap-reactive-platform/), a media discovery app moving from Ruby to Scala. 

And if it seems like something you'd need doing, [let us know](http://softwaremill.com/contact)!
