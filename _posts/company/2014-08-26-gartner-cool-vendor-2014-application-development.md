##About SoftwareMill

Our developers have 8+ years of experience in developing systems using Scala and Java based technologies such as Akka, JEE, Struts, Hadoop, Hibernate, JSF as well as JavaScript, Angular, the cloud (Amazon Web Services), SQL and NoSQL databases and other. 


We combine world-class technical expertise with great project management skills and have experience in very diverse projects: from high volume apps (banking systems, SMS gateways), through social web apps (social TV app) to both backend and UI-rich systems for school management. 

We believe that small, focused teams, working closely with the client deliver the best, word-class software.
