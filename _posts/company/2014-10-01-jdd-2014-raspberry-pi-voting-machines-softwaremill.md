Remember our [3DP Raspberry Pi voting machine post](https://softwaremill.com/3dp-raspberry-pi-ibeacon-conference-voting-machine/)? We thought it'd be a one-time adventure. As it turns out, more and more conferences introduce insta-feedback contraptions. While contacting the Proidea foundation concerning a [Scala Times](http://scalatimes.com) partnership with the [Java Development Day 2014](http://14.jdd.org.pl/) conference, the JDD crew said they liked our voting system from Confitura. And wanted to have it at JDD! 

Needless to say, it was a no brainer! Here's how the machines will look like:

</div>

Our own [Jacek](https://twitter.com/rucek), one of the voting machines' creators, will install the machines at JDD. Find him if you're intrigued how we put them together. 

Plus, [Magda](https://twitter.com/magdastozek) (the ZG JUG leader) and [Mirek](https://twitter.com/mirekwozniak), Scala Times editor, will be present at JDD as well - if you're curious about how remote [communication](https://softwaremill.com/skype-hipchat-slack-quest/), [retrospectives](https://softwaremill.com/remote-distributed-retrospective-tools/) or [hiring](https://softwaremill.com/hiring-developers-remote-distributed-company/) work, we'll be there - let's have a chat! 

Expect an exhaustive JDD review later, too - watch this space.
