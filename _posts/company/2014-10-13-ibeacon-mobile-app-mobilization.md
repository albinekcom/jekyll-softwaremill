[Mobilization](http://www.mobilization.pl/) is one of Poland's biggest mobile conferences - this year powered by SoftwareMill's copper sponsorship and our own iBeacon mobile app. The app idea started as [a part of our support of the Confitura conference](https://softwaremill.com/android-ios-ibeacon-conference-app/) and we've been developing it ever since. 

Plus, if you're a mobile developer and a solid back-end for your application, why not have a chat with us? We've got a decent experience building scalable infrastructure for [Yap.TV](https://softwaremill.com/scaling-ruby-scala-yap-reactive-platform/) and [Emotiful](https://softwaremill.com/scala-startup-emotiful-large-scale-social-app/), both with 90% mobile traffic. Just let us know at hello@softwaremill.com and let's get the ball rolling!
