We're quite diverse when it comes to the projects we take on. From flashy startups to workhorse corporate infrastructure. Or Cloud management, for this matter. Meet [Zerigo](http://www.zerigo.com/) - the feature-rich VMware View Hosted VDI and VMware-based Cloud Servers.

Our team joined Zerigo some time ago, with [Michał](https://twitter.com/mmatloka) and [Jacek](https://twitter.com/rucek) working on the improved and extended a broker which unifies multiple VMware products’ APIs into a single REST API with complex asynchronous execution support and informative error handling.
