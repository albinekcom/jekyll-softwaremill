[Scalar](http://scalar-conf.com) is back! After [the very warm welcome in 2014](http://softwaremill.com/scalar-summary), we've decided it's high time to start working on Scalar 2015. 

<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">

Scalar 2015 will take place on **11.04.2015 in Warsaw**. As for the format & content, stay tuned, we're still ironing out the details. But we may promise today that it'll be way, way better than in 2014. Just wait and see!

In the meantime, we'd love to work on Scalar together - if you've got something on your mind, a partnership, helping out or just saying hello, [drop us a line](mailto:hello@scalar-conf.com) - we'll get back to you shortly! And remember to follow [Scalar on Twitter](https://twitter.com/scalarconf) for fresh news!
