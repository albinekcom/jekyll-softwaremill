[Scala eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1948-scala-exchange-2014) is a Scala conference by Skills Matter in London with our own [Adam Warski](http://twitter.com/adamwarski) talking about Scala Dependency Injection Framework there. It's just in a few days, so you can still check [the handbook Adam's created on the topic](http://di-in-scala.github.io/).

Besides that, we got in touch with the organizers when talking about our own [Scala Times](http://scalatimes.com) and offered [our trusted iBeacon conference app](https://softwaremill.com/android-ios-ibeacon-conference-app/) (employed at Mobilization and Confitura). Thus, in addition to Adam's talk, you'll be able to try our own mobile software and meet the app/iBeacon crew - [Michał Mital](https://twitter.com/michalmital) and [Krzysiek Grajek](https://twitter.com/grajo) will go there as well, tuning up the app where needed. Make sure to grab a coffee with them!
