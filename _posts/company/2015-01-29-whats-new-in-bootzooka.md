In this blog post I would like to put a spotlight on most important changes we have recently
made in [Bootzooka](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka).

If you've never heard about Bootzooka before - it's an open-source scaffolding project for web applications
build on top of [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) frameworks.
Project is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka) under Apache 2.0 License
which means you can freely use any part of it.

Bootzooka has been actively developed for all the time, but in the last few weeks we introduced changes that have
noticeable impact on the whole project. Let's take a look on it:

## We dropped MongoDB
While MongoDB is a really great document store it has a limited scope of application which may be problematic when
you're developing the scaffold.
With such project you cannot predict where it will be used and have absolutely no guarantee that NoSQL will fit
particular project's needs.

Thus we decided to replace it with the traditional SQL database which has a wider scope of application, thereby making
Bootzooka more universal.

We chose [H2 SQL database](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) because it's lightweight and doesn't require any
3rd party software to be running (e.g. `mongod`).
This simplifies both development on a local machine and a Continuous Integration (CI) process.

[Rogue](https://github.com/foursquare/rogue) was replaced with [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) - the library which
allows to access & query SQL database in the type safe manner.

## Painless database schema evolution
Explicit schema comes with the need of applying DDL scripts whenever it evolves.
Often such scripts are applied manually during deployment, which makes whole process more complex (you have to check
which scripts are already applied at the particular environment and which one you have to apply as next)
and error-prone (e.g. you may forget to apply one of scripts or apply them in a wrong order).

Bootzooka has been integrated with [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) - tool that can automatically apply appropriate
DDL & DML scripts.
You only need to put your scripts under `db/migration/` directory (which must be present in the classpath) and obey the
[Flyway's naming convention](http://flywaydb.org/documentation/migration/sql.html).

Bootzooka store its schema evolution SQLs under `bootzooka-backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

Migration will be performed automatically on an application start.

Also, by extending `FlatSpecWithSql` you can bring Flyway to your integration tests and catch any problems with scripts
during regular CI (which usually is done right after problematic change was pushed to the repository).

## Interactive REST API documentation
APIs of our REST services are documented using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).
We also included [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) - a tool that generates interactive
documentation from Swagger-compliant API.

The interactive API docs are available at `<Bootzooka URL>/api-docs`.
The raw JSON produced by Swagger lives at `<Bootzooka URL>/rest/api-docs`.

That's all about interesting changes in the backend. Let's check what has changed at the client-side!

## New views' routing
We decided to replace plain old uri-oriented Angular's ng-router with modern, states-oriented
[ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).
New mechanism is more flexible and supports parallel & nested views, which makes master-detail
views development a piece of cake :)

## Brand new user notification service and directive
Old notification mechanism had a big disadvantage - it could display only one message of particular type
(error or info) at the same time.

I has been replaced with dedicated `NotificationsService` (available in `smlBootzooka.notifications` module)
that aggregates notifications and `<bs-notifications />` directive which dynamically creates
pop-ups for each notification incoming from the given source.

[Micha≈Ç Ostruszka](https://twitter.com/mostruszka) came out with a brilliant idea of
[decoupling directive from messages provider](http://michalostruszka.pl/blog/2015/01/18/angular-directives-di/).
Such separation allows us to include many notification directives displaying different kind of content on the
same page. Re-usability has been increased :)

---------

That's all of noticeable changes. We also updated Scala, Scalatra, AngularJS
and other dependencies to the most recent stable versions, to keep Bootzooka up to date.

Any kind of suggestions, ideas and pull requests are welcomed!
