What is most important in cooperation with external software developers? What questions should be asked before making the decision?
We develop software for clients around the world. Each time they wonder whether to work with us, they ask us the same set of questions about our workflow, quality, people and communication. We are sure that cooperation is also a matter of confidence.

Answers are fundamental to know what is our approach and what the CTOs can expect from us. We’ve added some useful questions. We hope it is also a good litmus test to check other software houses.

**Quality**

1. _How do you assure software quality?_
Each small piece of functionality of projects developed by SoftwareMill is covered by an automated test. In addition to low-level tests, we maintain a set of high-level "acceptance" tests verifying whether the product works properly. It is all automated in order to get a fast feedback.

>Example: We will have an automated test simulating 'clicking' through your web application.

Moreover, our developers review each other's code, in order to achieve better internal design, avoid mistakes and share knowledge.

2. _What tools do you use in your development process?_
Our teams usually use:
**Git** - a flexible source control system
**IntelliJ IDEA** - the best Java development environment
**TeamCity** - for continuous integration and testing
**Trello, Jira** - agile project management tools
**Confluence** - an enterprise wiki for documentation and knowledge sharing
**Reviewboard, Codebrag** or similar system for code reviews
and many other tools, because everyone is allowed to purchase a tool that will improve their productivity.

3. _What programming technologies will you use, and why?_
We are experts in modern technologies. However, first of all we check what is appropriate for client’s project to find a solution that suits their business best.

4. _Are you good enough?_
Wondering if we are the best choice? Let us prove how awesome we are! Let’s start the project by developing the 1st sprint. We offer a trial. It means we work for a period of 2 weeks (1 iteration) after which (depending on the results and the client's satisfaction) we either continue working, or the client can decide to resign without paying (in this case not receiving the results of the work).


5. _What forms of security do you use?_
Our organizational model minimizes the occurrence of all kinds of risks associated with the process of software development:
+ **Flat organization structure** - all the problems are solved by the project team
New IT equipment with extended warranty - we purchase the latest computers (mostly Apple) and extend the warranty to 3 years from purchase.
+ **Remote organization** - local power failure or local lack of Internet access will never affect the entire project team
+ **Cloud systems** - we use systems that perform regular back-ups and provide professional support
+ **Implementation of projects in accordance with the agile methodology** - the system is created in 2-week iterations, after which the software is delivered to the customer
+ **Insurance** - we are insured in case of a Cyber Disaster that could affect the company


**People**

6. _Who is in the team?_
SoftwareMill provides experienced development teams (IT developers, quality analysts, designers, business analysts) to its clients in order to understand clients’ needs, design and implement them.
We hire only senior developers from Poland. They are fully equipped with information and knowledge to solve every challenge by themselves.
The people who will work on the project are only the ones that the client meets, and each of us is presented on our webpages. We do not cooperate with anonymous subcontractors.

7. _How does your team extend their skill set?_
We gather knowledge and experience both from inside the company and outside (e.g. conferences).
We keep track of what we have learned on our common wiki and we regularly
(every Friday) ask each other what we have learned recently. The most interesting experiences are later discussed on our monthly knowledge sharing meetings.
We also run our own projects: [Codebrag](http://codebrag.com), [UpdateImpact] (http://www.updateimpact.com).
Within the last couple of months our developers attended the following conferences:
[Scalar Conference](http://scalar-conf.com)
[JDD](http://15.jdd.org.pl)
[CodePot] (https://codepot.pl)
[Mobile Trends Conference](http://www.2016.mobiletrends.pl)
[GeeCON](http://2015.geecon.org)
[GeeCON Microservices] (http://2015.microservices.geecon.org)
[DevCrowd](http://2015.devcrowd.pl)
[Scala Days](http://scaladays.org)
[4Developers](http://www.4developers.org.pl/pl)
[InfoShare](http://www.infoshare.pl)
[Devoxx Poland](http://devoxx.pl)
[Devoxx Morocco](http://devoxx.ma/en)
[Confitura](http://2015.confitura.pl)
[Scala eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6862-scala-exchange-2015)
[WebSummit](https://websummit.net)
[InternetBeta](http://internetbeta.pl)
[Analyst Relations Forum](http://analystrelationsforum.com)
[Voxxed Days](http://voxxeddays.com/vilnius15)

8. _Do members of your team actively contribute to professional IT communities (blogs, conference presentations, user groups, etc.)?_
Most of us are active bloggers or twitterers - see our [blog](https://softwaremill.com/blog)
and [team] (https://softwaremill.com/meet-the-team).
We have delivered so many presentations on various conferences, that we already lost count. Basically, on most of the events listed in the previous point there was someone presenting from SoftwareMill - check it [below blogposts](http://softwaremill.com/blog).
Several members of SoftwareMill team are (co-)leaders of Java User Groups (Warsaw JUG, Polish JUG, Szczecin JUG, Zielona Góra JUG).
We have organised two editions of an international conference about the Scala language in Warsaw [Scalar Conference](http://scalar-conf.com).
We are also a member of the [Polish Space Industry Association](http://space.biz.pl/main).

**Cooperation**

9. _How can I track the progress of my project?_
We usually set up a Skype chat for the team and the client, so it is usually just a matter of asking about progress.
The client also has full access to our project management tool (or we use client’s tool). There, the client can check out the [burndown chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart)on the iteration or project level. Every two weeks we demonstrate to the client a working version of the product, with more and more features implemented.
See [the graph](https://softwaremill.com/services/) which shows how we deliver software solutions.
Each time, we adjust the process to meet the particular needs of the client and the project.

10. _What happens if I change my mind about the way my product should work?_
No worries at all. Good test coverage allows us to safely make changes in the project.
With _Time&Materials_ model there is no need to renegotiate the contract or submit formal Change Requests.


11. _What is your advantage?_
We want to deliver software that matters to our business clients.
+ offering nearshoring from Poland - highly-skilled and motivated developers working in similar time zone and able to regularly visit clients’ offices
+ providing a small, efficient team of experienced full-stack developers, able to shift focus in a very agile way (e.g. from backend to frontend)
+ offering very close cooperation with business - as part of our company culture
+ cooperation with the Typesafe -  SoftwareMill is a Select System Integrator

We take care of developing projects end-to-end, always trying to keep in mind that we want to develop maintainable, working software which brings value to our clients.

Sometimes potential clients ask for a contact to our current customers. It’s obvious for us, so we’re in touch with people who have already trusted us.
