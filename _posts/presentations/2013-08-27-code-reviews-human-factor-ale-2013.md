A couple of months ago I picked a single software development practice – performing code reviews – and talked with
lots of various people on their experience with it. This turned out to be a topic far beyond tooling and
more about feelings, emotions, judgement and receiving criticism.

Lots of interesting ideas on how to make code reviews more enjoyable emerged from these conversations. In this short talk I will share some of them.
