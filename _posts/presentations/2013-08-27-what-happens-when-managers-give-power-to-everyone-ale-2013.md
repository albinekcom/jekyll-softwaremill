I want to share very early experience of what happened in my company (21-people, all distributed and working remotely),
which this June pivoted from somehow hierarchical to completely flat structure (open books, open everything, no managers).

This will bw a true story of finding ways for effective collaborative decision making, developers outvoting CEO
and all of us learning to talk about money.

Note: As slides are not very informative without hearing the speaker, we suggest you to read more about this idea on our blog
[20 CEOs in one company](https://softwaremill.com/20-ceos-in-one-company/).
