Contrary to common belief, distributed team can actually make it easier to adapt an agile approach to
software development. Compared with the co-located group, a distributed team experiences what I call
a shift in visibility. The hours spent in the office no longer count, therefore more focus is placed
on actual work done and business value delivered. If your team suffers from poor communication or
endless meetings, working remotely will make this even more conspicuous.

This talk is based on my experience in working remotely for over 7 years in various environments,
which led me to believe that working in a distributed environment is like using Scrum - it does not
solve your problems, but makes them more visible.
