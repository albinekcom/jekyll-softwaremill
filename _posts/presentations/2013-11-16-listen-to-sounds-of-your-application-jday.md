There are lots of valuable signals in our systems that we can capture and measure. Aside from monitoring physical
resources and latencies, we can bring visibility to business data that we care about. We will present how to create
a monitoring and alerting stack which gives a uniform view of those signals.

Given such setup we can detect anomalies or system failures or examine how our application usage changes and plan
our capacity in advance. During this 30 minute talk we will try to convince you – the Java developer – why you should care
about applications metrics and logging from early on in development.
