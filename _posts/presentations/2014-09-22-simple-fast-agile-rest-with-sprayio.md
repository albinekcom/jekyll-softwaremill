Spray, once a stand-alone project, now part of Akka, is a toolkit for building and consuming REST services. 

In the live-coding talk we will build a simple REST service with Spray, and then consume it with a Spray-based client. No code can live without tests, so we’ll take care of that as well. 

We will see that new routes can be added very quickly, how to use type-safe query and path parameters, as well as how to create custom directives, reusing existing code. All in a functional, asynchronous setting! 

You’ll see that building REST services can be really simple - no containers, minimal boilerplate, fast development time!
