It’s certainly fashionable to "be reactive", but what does it mean? How does reactive look in practice? Akka contains a number of more or less experimental modules, with which we can create a [Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, Message driven]-application. We will see how various Akka features help in implementing the above traits. The presentation will contain a short introduction to the reactive ideology, and then we will try to write a reactive application using Akka Cluster, Akka Streams and Akka Persistence.
