During this 'live-coding' presentation, we will implement a couple of stream data processing examples using both the Akka-Stream and Scalaz-stream libraries, introducing their core concepts and highlighting key differences.

Stream data processing is becoming increasingly popular, providing elegant abstractions to solve a large number of everyday problems. Plus itâ€™s at the core of the "reactive" movement! The akka-stream and scalaz-stream libraries are the two popular libraries for single-node stream processing in the Scala ecosystem.

Both libraries share a common design goal, to provide compositionality, but they take different routes to satisfy that requirement. [Akka-stream](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/1.0-M2/scala.html) puts an emphasis on implementing the reactive streams standard and is actor-based, while [scalaz-stream](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream) aims at isolating effects and providing a possibly pure FP library. This talk compares and contrasts these systems.
