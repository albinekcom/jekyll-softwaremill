          <a title="Apache Struts" href="http://struts.apache.org">The Apache Struts</a> framework is widely used over
          the Internet and by many intranet websites. It&#8217;s a mature technology, but as with all widely-adopted
          software there is a high risk of hacker attacks, which will only grow over time. The latest discovered
          <a href="http://struts.apache.org/development/2.x/docs/security-bulletins.html" rel="nofollow">security
            vulnerabilities</a> show how risky it can be to use an unsecured framework, especially if the application is
          publicly available online.
        </p>

          If you want to be safe and secure, you should seriously consider obtaining professional support.
          <a title="Apache Struts" href="http://struts.apache.org">The Apache Struts</a> is open source software,
          developed by volunteers who cannot guarantee 24/7 professional support.
