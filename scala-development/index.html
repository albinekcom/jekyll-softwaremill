          <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is gaining popularity at SoftwareMill. We started a couple of
          years ago with a single project based purely on Scala, and now almost all new projects use Scala in some way,
          with over half of SoftwareMill coders knowing Scala very well.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Over and above being an expressive, scalable and fun language to write in, Scala has a rich ecosystem that is
          one of the main things which make it so great. The <a href="http://typesafe.com/">Typesafe</a> stack and
          frameworks like <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>, <a href="http://spray.io/">Spray</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a> or <a href="http://scalatra.org/">Scalatra</a> make
          it much simpler and more efficient to achieve our daily development tasks.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          Traditionally at SoftwareMill we try to give back to the community. We have been sharing our Scala experience
          at conferences such as JavaZone, Devoxx, Confitura and BuildStuff. We also run some open source projects (see
          below).

          Scala is perfect for big projects, as it’s really productive. It enables developers to reduce the size of the
          source code by a factor of at least&nbsp;2 or 3 compared to Java.

          <strong>Case study: Yap.TV&nbsp;</strong>
        <p>
          We developed the backend system for Yap.TV, a social TV app. The backend spans multiple servers, and is
          implemented using Akka and Spray. Used since the inception of the project, Scala has proved a powerful and
          concise language allowing us to create readable code and deliver features quickly at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Case study: transforming data with Hadoop</strong></p>
        <p>
          We developed the backend for an analysis application that aggregates information regarding various customer
          behaviour patterns. Using this data, merchants are able to plan their marketing campaigns. To achieve the
          goals of this project, we used the Scala language together with Apache Hadoop and Apache Pig to transform the
          customer data, and Spray to serve&nbsp;the results.

        <p>A number of our open source projects are based on Scala. Firstly, there is
          <a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka">Bootzooka</a> – <br>a template web application, using
          modern technologies and a modern stack:
        </p>
        <p>
        <br />
        • Scalatra for creating REST APIs<br/>
        • AngularJS, stylus, Twitter Bootstrap for the frontend<br/>
        • joint SBT/Grunt build process<br/>
        • Scala as the main backend development language<br/>
        • Akka for asynchronous and background processing<br/>
        • MongoDB as a persistent store<br/>
        <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka">Bootzooka</a> allows us to start a new project&nbsp;quickly,
          and deliver value to our customers as fast as possible. We are also running a series of smaller open source
          projects: <a href="https://github.com/adamw/veripacks">Veripacks</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq">ElasticMQ</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adamw/macwire">MacWire</a>.
          All written and leveraging the huge possibilities of Scala.
